# DALEC

DALEC (Direct Asymmetric End Ligation Capture) is a method I developed as part of my graduate dissertation. DALEC couples transgene-driven expression of _E. coli_ DNA Adenine Methyltransferase (DAM) to Next-Generation Sequencing to interrogate global chromatin changes in living cells during tissue differentiation.

This repository contains Java source codes I wrote for processing and analyzing Illumina NGS data from the project. Please refer to the publication below for details of the study.
